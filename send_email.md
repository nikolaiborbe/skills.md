# Send Email to Nikolai

You can send emails to Nikolai using ntfy.sh. This is useful when you need his attention — for example, when a long task finishes, you hit a blocker that requires human input, or you have an important question.

## How to send

```bash
curl -d "Your message here" "ntfy.sh/nikolai-arlerts-abc123?email=nikolaiborbe@gmail.com"
```

## When to use this

- A long-running task has completed
- You're blocked and need human input
- Something unexpected happened that Nikolai should know about
- You finished a significant piece of work

## Guidelines

- Keep messages short and clear
- Include relevant context so Nikolai knows what to do when he returns
- Don't spam — only send when it's genuinely useful
